# Meshtastic-LLM Bridge 📡🧠

**Version:** v0.2.0

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) | English

## 📋 TO-DO

- [ ] **Access control (security)** — the bridge currently responds to **any** inbound text message from **any** node on the mesh. Restrict responses to an allowlist of authorized radios (Travis's nodes) and ignore everyone else.
  - Add a `MESHTASTIC_ALLOWED_NODES` env var (comma-separated node IDs, e.g. `!aaaa1111,!bbbb2222`).
  - In `_on_receive` (`bridge.py`), compare `packet.get("fromId")` against the allowlist; drop (log, no LLM call) non-matches.
  - Accept both `!hex` and decimal node-number forms (normalize before comparing).
  - Decide + document default behavior when unset: fail-open (current) vs. fail-closed (recommended for a shared mesh).
  - Document the new env var in the README.
  - Manual test: authorized node gets a reply, unauthorized node does not.
- [ ] **Sidecar deployment** — wire the image into the Hermes pod as a sidecar (k3s-bootstrap, branch + PR). Point `LOCAL_LLM_1_BASE_URL` at the in-cluster vLLM endpoint for offline mode; ensure network access to the radio's TCP port.
- [ ] **Confirm authorized node allowlist** — verify which node IDs are actually Travis's radios before locking down (run `list_nodes.py` to identify your own radios).

A resilient, standalone Python bridge connecting your Meshtastic device to powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is designed for **"apocalypse-grade" off-grid communication**, allowing you to interact with AI even when the internet is down.

It intelligently switches between online (cloud LLM providers such as OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Anthropic, or any custom endpoint) and offline (local LLMs via any OpenAI-compatible backend, such as LM Studio or Ollama) modes, providing robust AI assistance in any scenario.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Provider LLM Fallback**: Configure any number of cloud LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Anthropic, or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint) as an ordered fallback list — if one fails, the bridge automatically tries the next. Same fallback mechanism for local/offline LLM backends (LM Studio, Ollama, or any self-hosted OpenAI-compatible server).
- **GPS-Aware Weather Queries**: Send a simple command like `"weather here"` from your device, and the bridge will automatically use your node's GPS location to fetch the local weather forecast. No manual coordinates needed!
- **Government Alert Broadcast**: In online mode, the bridge actively monitors Taiwan's NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction) CAP feed. If a severe alert (earthquake, typhoon, air raid, etc.) is issued, it will be automatically broadcast to all devices on the mesh network (`^all`).
- **Robust LLM Response Handling**: Normalizes both object-style and dict-style responses across OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-style APIs, ensuring stability across different providers and backends.
- **Meshtastic Communication**: Uses the Meshtastic Python API (`meshtastic.serial_interface.SerialInterface`) directly, subscribing to incoming messages via `pypubsub` and sending with `sendText`/`sendAlert`. Automatically detects and recovers from serial disconnects in the background.
- **Message Chunking & Pagination**: Automatically splits long LLM responses into multiple Meshtastic packets with pagination (`(1/3)`) due to LoRa's limited payload size.
- **Resource Optimization**: Designed for low-bandwidth, low-power Meshtastic networks.
- **Easy Setup**: Runs as a standalone Python script with `.env` configuration.

### Disaster Info Tools

- **Shelter Finder**: Ask about nearby emergency shelters (`find_shelter` LLM tool), backed by Taiwan's National Fire Agency shelter dataset (works offline, no internet required). Results are cross-checked against a community-maintained coordinate-errata list ([WaytoSafety](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@waytosafety/home/), part of g0v's [DigiResiThon](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@paulpengtw/DigiResiTh0n-home) resilience effort) and flagged with a warning if the official coordinates are known to be inaccurate.
- **SOS Broadcast**: Send `SOS` (optionally followed by a message, e.g. `SOS trapped on 2nd floor`) to broadcast your GPS location and timestamp to the entire mesh via Meshtastic's `ALERT_APP` priority channel. Rate-limited to once per 60 seconds per node to prevent accidental flooding.
- **Safety Check-in**: Send `SAFE` or `平安` (optionally with a message) to broadcast that you're safe, same rate-limiting applies.

## 💡 Why this project?

Most LLM solutions rely entirely on internet connectivity. **Meshtastic-LLM Bridge** offers unparalleled resilience:
- **True Off-Grid AI**: Ensures you always have access to AI assistance, even in emergencies or remote locations without internet.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Leverages the best of both worlds: powerful cloud LLMs when online, and robust local LLMs when offline.
- **Open Source & Customizable**: A foundation for building your own specialized off-grid AI applications.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (via WSL2).
- **Python**: v3.9 or higher.
- **Meshtastic Device**: A working Meshtastic device connected via USB (or configurable for TCP/IP).
- **Local LLM** (optional, for offline chat and reasoning): Any OpenAI-compatible server works, for example:
  - **LM Studio** ([lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)): Recommended for ease of use (GUI). Download a **chat model**, then start the local server.
  - **Ollama** ([ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)): Command-line friendly. Install a **chat model** (e.g., `ollama run gemma:2b`). Ensure the Ollama server is running.

## 🔑 Account & Key Requirements

### For online/cloud mode
- At least one cloud LLM provider API key, e.g. [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Google AI Studio (Gemini)](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys), [Mistral](https://console.mistral.ai/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys), or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) — free tiers are available for several of these.

### For offline/local mode
- A local OpenAI-compatible LLM server (LM Studio, Ollama, or similar) — no API key required.

### Optional (for local tools / specialized functions)
- **CWA Open Data**: For weather forecasts in Taiwan.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harperbot/meshtastic-llm-bridge.git
cd meshtastic-llm-bridge
```

### 2. Prepare Python Environment
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install meshtastic[cli] requests python-dotenv openai anthropic feedparser pytest
```

### 3. Meshtastic Device Setup
- Connect your Meshtastic device via USB.
- Find its path: `meshtastic --info` (e.g., `/dev/cu.usbserial-0001` on macOS, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux).

### 4. Local LLM Setup (for Offline Mode)

#### Option A: LM Studio (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).
2. In LM Studio, download your preferred LLM (e.g., `Nexusflow/Starling-LM-7B-beta-GGUF`).
3. Go to the "Local Server" tab and click "Start Server". Ensure it's running on `http://localhost:1234/v1`.

#### Option B: Ollama
1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
2. Download your preferred LLM (e.g., `ollama run gemma:2b`).
3. Ensure the Ollama server is running (usually automatic after `ollama run`).

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
MESHTASTIC_DEVICE_PATH=/dev/ttyUSB0
MESHTASTIC_LONGNAME=MeshtasticAI
LOCALIZATION=TW

# Cloud LLM providers (ordered fallback list, numbered slots — add as many as you like)
# provider: openai | gemini | groq | mistral | openrouter | anthropic | custom
CLOUD_LLM_1_PROVIDER=openai
CLOUD_LLM_1_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
CLOUD_LLM_1_MODEL=gpt-4o
# CLOUD_LLM_1_BASE_URL=            # only needed for provider=custom, or to override the built-in default

CLOUD_LLM_2_PROVIDER=anthropic
CLOUD_LLM_2_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
CLOUD_LLM_2_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5

# Local LLM backends (ordered fallback list, any OpenAI-compatible server)
LOCAL_LLM_1_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1   # e.g. LM Studio
LOCAL_LLM_1_MODEL=your-local-model-name

LOCAL_LLM_2_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1  # e.g. Ollama's OpenAI-compat endpoint
LOCAL_LLM_2_MODEL=your-ollama-model-name

CWA_API_KEY=your_cwa_key_here
```

Only the slots you actually fill in get used — an incomplete or entirely absent numbered slot is skipped, and the bridge tries the next one. Both the cloud and local lists support any number of fallback entries.

## 🎮 Usage

1. Ensure your Meshtastic device is connected via USB and powered on.
2. If you're relying on offline/local mode, ensure your local LLM server is running.
3. Activate your Python virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Run the bridge: `python3 bridge.py`

Now, send messages to your AI node (e.g., `YourMeshAINode`) from your Meshtastic mobile app. The bridge will route your query through your configured cloud providers (online) or local providers (offline), trying each one in order until one succeeds.

## 📡 Architecture

This bridge employs a hybrid intelligence architecture:
1. **Meshtastic Python API Listener**: Opens a persistent `SerialInterface` connection to the radio and subscribes to `meshtastic.receive.text` via `pypubsub`, so incoming LoRa messages are delivered directly to the bridge process (no CLI subprocess involved). A separate `meshtastic.connection.lost` subscription triggers automatic background reconnection if the serial link drops.
2. **Internet Connectivity Check**: Periodically pings a reliable endpoint to determine online/offline status.
3. **Dynamic LLM Dispatch with Ordered Fallback**:
   - **Online**: Tries each configured cloud provider in order (`CLOUD_LLM_1`, `CLOUD_LLM_2`, ...) — OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Anthropic, or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint — falling back to the next one if a provider fails.
   - **Offline**: Tries each configured local provider in order (`LOCAL_LLM_1`, `LOCAL_LLM_2`, ...) against any OpenAI-compatible backend (e.g. LM Studio, Ollama), falling back to the next one if a backend is unreachable.
4. **Meshtastic Response Sender**: Formats LLM responses for Meshtastic's limited payload size, chunking and paginating long messages, then sends them via `interface.sendText()` (or `interface.sendAlert()` for high-priority SOS/alert broadcasts).

## 📝 Message Optimization for LoRa

Due to Meshtastic's low bandwidth, optimize your queries:
- **Be Concise**: Ask short, direct questions.
- **Use Keywords**: "Weather [City]", "Manual [Topic]", "Calc [Expression]".
- **Expect Summaries**: LLM responses will be limited to ~200 characters and may be paginated.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Encrypted Communication**: All traffic between the bridge and cloud/local LLM APIs is secured (HTTPS/local IPC).
- **Physical Security**: Your Meshtastic device and local computer should be in a secure location.
- **Local LLM Trust**: Ensure you trust the local LLM models you download, as they run on your machine.
